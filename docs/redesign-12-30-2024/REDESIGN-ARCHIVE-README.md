## Major Decisions Made

### 1. Combat System Redesign ✅
**Problem**: Sequential 3-phase combat (space → orbital → ground) = 1.2% attacker win rate
**Solution**: Unified combat resolution with single D20 roll, 6 outcomes
**Status**: Greenlit for Phase 1 implementation

### 2. Sector-Based Galaxy ✅
**Problem**: 100 empires with "attack anyone" = cognitive overload
**Solution**: 10 sectors of 10 empires each, phased expansion (sectors → borders → wormholes)
**Status**: Greenlit for Phase 2-3 implementation (13-15 days)

**Selected Approach**: Concept 2 (Regional Cluster Map)
- Galaxy view (10 sector boxes)
- Sector view (8-10 empire nodes)
- Wormholes as strategic connections
- Star Trek LCARS aesthetic

### 3. Coalition Mechanics ✅
**Problem**: Leaders become unstoppable
**Solution**: Automatic anti-leader bonuses at 7+ Victory Points
**Status**: Greenlit for Phase 1 implementation

### 4. Reduced Starting Planets ✅
**Change**: 9 → 5 starting planets
**Rationale**: Faster eliminations, achievable in 200 turns
**Status**: Approved

### 5. Onboarding System ✅
**Approach**: 5-step tutorial (required first game, skippable on replay)
**Philosophy**: "Every game is someone's first game" (Stan Lee / Mark Rosewater)
**Status**: Greenlit for Phase 3 implementation

## What Was Considered But Not Chosen

### Starmap Concepts
- **Concept 1 (Radial Sphere)**: Static radial layout, player at center
  - Rejected: Lacks galaxy feel, limited player control
- **Concept 3 (Tactical Filter)**: Three filter modes with mini-map
  - Rejected: Doesn't solve enough problems, Concept 2 scored higher

### Complexity Reduction (Under Evaluation)
- Archetype reduction (8 → 4): Pending playtesting
- Civil status simplification (8 → 3): Pending balance review
- Crafting system: Evaluating strategic value vs busywork

---

## Where Ideas Ended Up

### Consolidated into `/docs/VISION.md`
The comprehensive VISION document now contains:
- Combat system redesign (unified resolution)
- Sector-based galaxy structure
- Coalition mechanics
- Onboarding philosophy
- All greenlit features
- **NEW (2025-12-30 Evening)**: MMO framing language ("Crusader Kings meets Eve Online")
- **NEW**: "Natural selection is the content" design principle

### Consolidated into `/docs/PRD.md` (v2.0)
PRD updated with:
- Section 6: Galaxy Structure & Geography (NEW)
- Section 7: Combat system (updated to unified resolution)
- Section 9: Coalition mechanics (NEW subsection)
- Starting planets changed to 5
- Key Decisions table updated

### Tracked in `/docs/IMPLEMENTATION-TRACKER.md` (Main Tracker)
Living document tracking:
- What's implemented ✅
- What's in progress 🚧
- What's planned 📋
- What's under evaluation 💭

**NEW Sections Added (2025-12-30 Evening)**:
- **Session & Campaign Management** - Game creation flow, mode selection, session save/resume (NO save-scumming)
- **Boss Emergence & Coalition Raids** - Raid bonuses tied to boss detection, feature-flagged
- **Underdog & Punching Up Mechanics** - Two variants, both feature-flagged for playtesting
- **Advanced Connection Types** - Trade routes as attack relay, hazardous zones
- **Feature Flags for Playtesting** - Reference table of all experimental toggles

## Three Independent Reviews

**Starmap Concept 2** was evaluated from three perspectives:

1. **Sarah (Newbie Player)**: 7/10
   - Loved Star Trek aesthetic
   - Needed more guardrails (turn goals, feedback tooltips)
   - Wanted simpler early UI

2. **Marcus (Experienced Player)**: 8.5/10
   - Sectors create real strategic pacing
   - Concerned about sector balancing and wormhole spam
   - "This is what modern SRE should look like"

3. **Elena (Game Designer)**: 7.5/10
   - Elegant core design (one system solves multiple problems)
   - Critical: Sector balancing algorithm is P0 (must have)
   - Recommend implementation with iteration (13-15 days)

**Consensus**: Implement Concept 2 with Priority 0 changes (sector balancing, victory tutorial, contextual UI, wormhole limits)

## Key Learnings

### What Worked
1. **Playtesting revealed truth** - 1.2% win rate was invisible until stress tests
2. **Multiple perspectives helped** - Three independent reviews converged on same issues
3. **Diagrams clarified thinking** - Mermaid + ASCII wireframes made concepts concrete
4. **Comparison to original** - SRE had coalition code we were missing

### What Didn't Work Initially
1. **Sequential combat phases** - Philosophically sound, mathematically broken
2. **"Attack anyone" galaxy** - No strategic geography with 100 empires
3. **Assuming eliminations would happen** - Math proved otherwise

### Design Principles Established
1. "Every game is someone's first game"
2. "Geography creates strategy"
3. "Consequence over limits"
4. "Clarity through constraints"
5. "Foundation before complexity"

## For Future Developers

If you're reading this and wondering "why did we make these choices?", read in this order:

1. **ELIMINATION-INVESTIGATION.md** - Understand the problem
2. **GAME-DESIGN-EVALUATION.md** - See the evaluation process
3. **PATH-FORWARD.md** - Understand the decision framework
4. **STARMAP-CONCEPT2-REVIEWS.md** - See how we chose the starmap approach
5. **VISION.md** - See the final consolidated vision

The design process was iterative, evidence-based, and considered multiple perspectives. These weren't arbitrary choices - they solved real problems revealed through testing.
