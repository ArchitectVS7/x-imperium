# X-Imperium: Core Mechanics

## Game Structure

### Turn System
- **Single-player**: Player takes turn, then all 99 bots process instantly
- **No waiting**: Results available immediately
- **Turn limit**: Configurable per scenario (default: 200 turns)
- **Protection period**: 20 turns at game start (cannot attack or be attacked)

### Victory Conditions
Victory is **scenario-based**. Each scenario defines its win condition:
- Highest networth at turn limit
- Reach target credit amount
- Eliminate X empires
- Complete all research levels
- Last empire standing
- Custom conditions

## Resources

### Primary Resources

| Resource | Description | Primary Source | Primary Use |
|----------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Credits** | Currency | Tourism planets, taxes | Buying planets, military, operations |
| **Food** | Sustenance | Food planets | Population, military upkeep |
| **Ore** | Industrial material | Ore planets | Military maintenance |
| **Petroleum** | Fuel | Petroleum planets | Military maintenance |

### Research Points
- Generated by Research planets
- Used for tech tree progression
- **Tradeable** on global market
- Can be spent for **temporary boosts**:
  - Combat effectiveness buff (1 turn)
  - Production multiplier (1 turn)
  - Covert success bonus (1 turn)

### Resource Flow
```
Production (planets) → Stockpile → Consumption (maintenance)
                           ↓
                    Market (buy/sell)
```

**Deficit Handling**: If resources run negative, the game auto-purchases from market. If you can't afford market prices, bad things happen:
- Food deficit: Population starves
- Credit deficit: Military deserts
- Ore/Petroleum deficit: Military effectiveness drops

## Planets

### Starting Configuration
**9 planets** distributed as:
| Planet Type | Count | Purpose |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| Food | 2 | Feed population |
| Ore | 2 | Military upkeep |
| Petroleum | 1 | Military fuel |
| Tourism | 1 | Income generation |
| Urban | 1 | Population capacity |
| Government | 1 | Covert agent capacity |
| Research | 1 | Tech progression |

### Planet Types (10)

| Type | Production | Base Cost | Notes |
|------|------------|-----------|-------|
| **Food** | 160 food/turn | 8,000 | Essential for survival |
| **Ore** | 112 ore/turn | 6,000 | Military maintenance |
| **Petroleum** | 92 petro/turn | 11,500 | Creates pollution |
| **Tourism** | 8,000 credits/turn | 8,000 | Main income source |
| **Urban** | +population cap, +1,000 credits | 8,000 | House citizens |
| **Education** | +civil status | 8,000 | Happiness boost |
| **Government** | +300 covert capacity | 7,500 | Spy operations |
| **Research** | Research points | 23,000 | Tech progression |
| **Supply** | -military cost | 11,500 | Cheaper production |
| **Anti-Pollution** | -pollution | 10,500 | Offset petroleum |

### Planet Costs
Prices **increase** as you own more planets:
```
Cost = BaseCost × (1 + OwnedPlanets × 0.05)
```

## Population

### Civil Status
Population happiness affects income multiplier:

| Status | Multiplier | Caused By |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| **Ecstatic** | +4x | Many victories, high education |
| **Happy** | +3x | Stable, winning |
| **Content** | +2x | Normal state |
| **Neutral** | +1x | Minor problems |
| **Unhappy** | 0x | Starvation, losses |
| **Angry** | -penalties | Severe problems |
| **Rioting** | -severe | Extended problems |
| **Revolting** | Empire collapse risk | Critical failure |

### Population Mechanics
- **Growth**: Population grows each turn (if fed)
- **Consumption**: Each citizen eats 0.05 food/turn
- **Housing**: Urban planets increase population cap
- **Recruitment**: Population required for military units

## Combat

### Combat Types

#### 1. Invasion
Full-scale attack to capture planets.

**Requirements**:
- Out of protection period
- Carriers to transport troops
- One invasion per turn limit

**Process**:
1. Select target empire
2. Choose units to send
3. Three-phase battle resolves:
   - **Space Combat**: Cruisers fight cruisers
   - **Orbital Combat**: Fighters vs stations
   - **Ground Combat**: Soldiers capture planets

**Victory**: Capture 5-15% of enemy planets
**Defeat**: Lose attacking forces, effectiveness drops

#### 2. Guerilla Attack
Quick raid without carriers.

- Uses only soldiers
- Lower risk, lower reward
- Good for harassment

#### 3. Nuclear Warfare
Devastating strike (requires Black Market).

- Purchase nukes for 500M credits
- 40% base population damage
- Target may detect and foil

### Combat Mechanics
- **Battle rounds**: Up to 20 per invasion
- **Defense bonus**: Defender gets 1.2x effectiveness
- **Randomness**: 20% variance factor
- **Carrier transport**: Capacity based on research level

### Attack Restrictions
Cannot attack:
- Empires in protection
- Coalition members
- Empires with active treaties
- Significantly weaker empires (unless they attacked first)

---

## Covert Operations

### Covert Points
- Earn 5 points per turn
- Maximum: 50 points
- Operations consume points

### Agent Capacity
- Maximum agents = Government planets × 300
- Agent cost: 4,090 credits each

### Available Operations

| Operation | Effect | Cost |
|-----------|--------|------|
| **Send Spy** | Reveal enemy stats | Low |
| **Insurgent Aid** | Support rebels | Medium |

| **Demoralize Troops** | Reduce effectiveness | Medium |
| **Bombing Operations** | Destroy resources | High |
| **Relations Spying** | Reveal diplomacy | Low |
| **Take Hostages** | Demand ransom | High |
| **Carriers Sabotage** | Damage carriers | Very High |
| **Communications Spying** | Intercept messages | Medium |
| **Setup Coup** | Overthrow government | Very High |

### Operation Outcomes
- **Success**: Achieve effect
- **Failure**: No effect, agent may be caught
- **Agent Caught**: Lose agent, target notified

Success rate based on:
- Your agent count vs target's
- Target's government planets
- Random factors

## Diplomacy

### Treaties
- **Propose**: Send treaty offer
- **Accept/Reject**: Respond to offers
- **Active**: Cannot attack each other
- **Break**: Cancel treaty (penalty applies)

### Coalitions
Groups of allied empires:
- Cannot attack coalition members
- Shared intelligence
- Coalition chat
- Combined networth ranking

### Bot Diplomacy
Bots form, maintain, and betray alliances based on:
- Personality type (Diplomat, Schemer, etc.)
- Trust scores
- Strategic opportunity
- Grudge lists

---

## Research

### Fundamental Research
8 levels of basic research:
- Each level costs exponentially more
- Completing all 8 = Tech Ascension victory (if enabled)
- Unlocks advanced unit research

### Unit Upgrades
Each unit has 3 upgrade levels (0, 1, 2):

**Soldiers**:
| Level | Guerilla | Ground | Pirate |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| 0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0.5 |
| 1 | 1.5 | 1.0 | 1.0 |
| 2 | 0.5 | 2.0 | 2.0 |

**Carriers**:
| Level | Toughness | Speed | Cargo |
|-------|-----------|-------|-------|
| 0 | 1x | 1x | 1.0x |
| 1 | 2x | 2x | 0.5x |
| 2 | 4x | 4x | 0.25x |

### Light Cruisers
- Cannot be purchased directly
- Obtained only through research
- Powerful space combat units

---

## Global Market

### Trading
- Buy/sell Food, Ore, Petroleum, Research Points
- Prices fluctuate based on supply/demand
- Price range: 0.4x to 1.6x base

| Resource | Base Price |
|----------|------------|
| Food | 80 |
| Ore | 120 |
| Petroleum | 300 |
| Research Points | Variable |

### Auto-Purchase
If you lack resources for maintenance:
- Game auto-buys at market price
- Bankruptcy → planet/military losses

## Networth Calculation

```
Networth = (Planets × 10)
         + (Soldiers × 0.0005)
         + (Fighters × 0.001)
         + (Stations × 0.002)
         + (Light Cruisers × 0.001)
         + (Heavy Cruisers × 0.002)
         + (Carriers × 0.005)
         + (Covert Agents × 0.001)
```

Networth determines:
- Ranking on scoreboard
- Victory in networth scenarios
- Attack restrictions vs weaker empires
