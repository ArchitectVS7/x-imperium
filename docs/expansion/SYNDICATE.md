# The Galactic Syndicate

**Status**: EXPANSION CONTENT - Not in Core Game v1.0
**Date**: Extracted from PRD.md 2026-01-02
**Prerequisites**: Core game complete, crafting expansion (optional synergy)

---

## Overview

The **Galactic Syndicate** is a criminal organization operating outside Coordinator jurisdiction, providing an alternative progression path for struggling empires.

**Design Goal**: Create comeback mechanics and asymmetric gameplay.

**Expansion Scope**: This system is **not** in the base game. If released as DLC, it would be packaged as "Nexus Dominion: Shadow War" or bundled with crafting expansion.

---

## What the Syndicate Offers

1. **Banned technologies** - WMDs (nuclear, chemical, biological weapons)
2. **Premium components** - Skip crafting requirements (if crafting expansion active)
3. **Contract work** - Trust building through missions
4. **Intelligence services** - Spy on rivals, leak secrets
5. **Comeback mechanics** - Bottom 50% players get recruitment bonuses

---

## Trust System (0-8 Levels)

Trust is earned through contracts and purchases. Higher trust unlocks better goods.

| Level | Points | Title | Unlocks |
|-------|--------|-------|---------|
| **0** | 0 | Unknown | Must complete intro contract |
| **1** | 100 | Associate | Components at 2x, basic intel |
| **2** | 500 | Runner | Pirate raid contracts, 1.75x prices |
| **3** | 1,500 | Soldier | Player contracts, Tier 2 at 1.5x |
| **4** | 3,500 | Captain | Targeted contracts, kingslayer |
| **5** | 7,000 | Lieutenant | Tier 3 systems (non-WMD), 1.5x |
| **6** | 12,000 | Underboss | Chemical weapons, EMP, 1.25x |
| **7** | 20,000 | Consigliere | Nuclear weapons |
| **8** | 35,000 | Syndicate Lord | Bioweapons, exclusive contracts, 1.0x |

**Trust Decay**: -5% every 10 turns of inactivity (encourages engagement)

---

## Contract System

Contracts are the primary way to build trust. They come in 4 tiers:

### Tier 1: Pirate Raids (Trust 1+)

Low-risk missions against NPC pirates.

| Contract | Target | Reward | Trust |
|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Supply Run** | Any pirate team | 5,000 Credits | +10 |
| **Disruption** | Specific pirate base | 8,000 Credits | +15 |
| **Salvage Op** | Destroy pirate ships, keep 50% | Varies | +20 |

### Tier 2: Standard Contracts (Trust 2+)

Covert operations against player empires.

| Contract | Target | Reward | Trust |
|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Intimidation** | Any player (insurgent aid) | 15,000 Credits | +30 |
| **Economic Warfare** | Any player (bomb food) | 25,000 Credits | +40 |
| **Military Probe** | Any player (guerilla attack) | 35,000 Credits | +50 |
| **Hostile Takeover** | Capture 1 planet from anyone | 50,000 Credits | +75 |

### Tier 3: Targeted Contracts (Trust 4+)

High-risk missions against top players.

| Contract | Target | Reward | Trust |
|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Kingslayer** | Top 3 player | 100,000 Credits | +100 |
| **Market Manipulation** | Top 10 player | 75,000 Credits | +80 |
| **Regime Change** | Top 25% player | 60,000 Credits | +60 |

### Tier 4: Syndicate Operations (Trust 6+)

Endgame contracts with massive impact.

| Contract | Target | Reward | Trust |
|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Proxy War** | Two specific players | 150,000 Credits | +120 |
| **Scorched Earth** | Specific empire (WMD) | Exclusive tech | +100 |
| **The Equalizer** | All Top 10% | Special item | +200 |

---

## Recruitment Mechanic (Comeback System)

**The Syndicate reaches out to struggling players.**

When a player falls into the **bottom 50%** of empires:
- They receive a **Syndicate Invitation** message
- First contract offered at **50% bonus trust** rewards
- One-time offer of **10,000 credits** "startup funds"
- Access to **Equalizer contracts** targeting top players

**Design Rationale**: This creates comeback mechanics — struggling players can acquire WMDs faster while top players must consider threats from below.

| Propulsion Units | 2,200 | 1 |

| **Chemical Weapons** | 50,000 | 6 | Kill 25% population | Coordinator penalty if caught |
| **EMP Device** | 75,000 | 6 | Disable defenses 3 turns | Temporary advantage |

| **Bioweapon Canister** | 150,000 | 8 | Kill 75% population | Most devastating, highest penalty |

---

## Coordinator Response (Betrayal Path)

If a player **reports to the Coordinator**:

### Benefits:
- +10% Coordinator funding bonus (permanent)
- Trust with Coordinator increases
- Removes Syndicate temptation

### Consequences:
- **Trust permanently reset to 0**
- Syndicate becomes **hostile**
- Random assassination attempts on generals/agents each turn
- Cannot re-engage with Syndicate (permanent burn)

**Design Choice**: Betrayal is a one-way door. Choose wisely.

---

## Trust Decay & Failure

| Action | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| No interaction for 10 turns | -5% trust decay |
| Failing contract deadline | -50% reward trust, lose 1 Trust Level |
| Reporting to Coordinator | Reset to Trust 0, +10% funding, Syndicate hostile |

---

## Integration with Base Game

**Without Crafting Expansion:**
- Syndicate offers credits, intel, WMDs
- Contract system provides alternate income source
- WMDs are unique to Syndicate (not craftable)

**With Crafting Expansion:**
- Syndicate also sells crafted components at premium
- Skip the crafting queue for instant gratification
- More valuable for players who don't have Industrial Planets

**Synergy**: The two expansions complement each other but work independently.

---

## Balance Considerations

**Pros (Why This Expansion Works):**
- Creates asymmetric gameplay (legal vs criminal paths)
- Provides comeback mechanics for losing players
- Adds moral choices (betray Syndicate vs stay loyal)
- WMDs create dramatic endgame moments

**Cons (Why It's Not in Base Game):**
- Adds complexity (trust system, contracts, black market)
- Can feel "pay to win" if not balanced carefully
- WMDs can create griefing in multiplayer (requires moderation)

**Solution**: Make it optional DLC. Players who want "underdog comeback" mechanics can add it.

## Full Specification

For complete implementation details, see:
- `docs/expansion/crafting-system.md` - Syndicate integration with crafting
- `src/lib/game/services/syndicate-service.ts` - Reference implementation
- `src/lib/game/constants/syndicate.ts` - Trust levels, contract definitions

## Alternative Vision (Hidden Traitor)

For a more dramatic implementation, see:
- `docs/redesign-01-02-2026/SYNDICATE-EXPANSION-CONCEPT.md` - Hidden role game variant

This document describes a "Betrayal at House on the Hill" style mechanic where some players secretly serve the Syndicate. More complex but potentially more engaging.

*This system is preserved for potential future expansion. Not planned for v1.0 release.*
