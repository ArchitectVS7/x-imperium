# Expansion Content

**STATUS: NOT IN BASE GAME V1.0**

These features are planned for post-launch DLC expansions. They add depth for hardcore players who want more complex economic and strategic systems.

## Expansion Packs

### "Industrial Age" - Crafting System

Adds a 4-tier resource progression that gates advanced military units behind strategic resource management.

- **[CRAFTING.md](CRAFTING.md)** - Full crafting system specification
- Transforms "credits buy everything" into strategic progression
- 4 tiers: Base → Refined → Components → Advanced Systems
- Industrial Sectors for manufacturing
- Crafting queue system

### "Shadow War" - Galactic Syndicate

Adds a criminal organization with contracts, black market, and comeback mechanics.

- **[SYNDICATE.md](SYNDICATE.md)** - Full syndicate specification
- 8-level trust progression
- Contract missions (4 tiers)
- Black Market for WMDs and components
- Recruitment mechanic for struggling empires

## Why These Aren't in Base Game

1. **Crafting** - Adds cognitive load (20+ resources), competes with core empire management
2. **Syndicate** - Parallel progression track that dilutes focus

**Solution**: Make them optional DLC for players who want deeper systems.
