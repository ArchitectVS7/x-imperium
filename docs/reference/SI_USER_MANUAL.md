| Happy | +3 income multiplier |
| Content | +2 income multiplier |
| Neutral | +1 income multiplier |
| Unhappy | No bonus |
| Angry | Reduced productivity |
| Rioting | Severe penalties |
| Revolting | Empire collapse risk! |

**Improving Civil Status:**

- Keep credits positive (pay your military)
- Build Education planets

---

## 4. Resources & Economy

### Primary Resources

#### Credits (Money)
Your empire's currency. Used for:
- Buying planets and military units
- Paying maintenance costs
- Trading on the market
- Covert operations

**Income Sources:**
- Tourism planets (8,000 credits per planet)
- Population tax
- Urban planet tax (1,000 credits per planet)
- Market trading

**Expenses:**
- Planet maintenance (168 credits per planet)
- Military maintenance
- Loan payments

#### Food
Essential for survival. Your population starves without it!

**Production:** Food planets produce 160 food units each
**Consumption:** Population eats 0.05 food per citizen

> **Warning:** If food runs negative, your empire will automatically buy from the market. If you can't afford market prices, your population starts dying!

#### Ore
Industrial material for military production.

**Production:** Ore planets produce 112 ore units each
**Used for:** Fighter, Station, Cruiser, and Carrier maintenance

#### Petroleum
Fuel for advanced military units.

**Production:** Petroleum planets produce 92 petroleum units each
**Used for:** Fighter, Light Cruiser, Heavy Cruiser, and Carrier maintenance
**Side Effect:** Creates pollution (offset by Anti-Pollution planets)

### Planet Types

| Planet Type | Function | Base Cost |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **Food** | Produces food | 8,000 |
| **Ore** | Produces ore | 6,000 |
| **Petroleum** | Produces petroleum | 11,500 |
| **Tourism** | Generates income | 8,000 |
| **Urban** | Increases population capacity | 8,000 |
| **Education** | Improves civil status | 8,000 |
| **Government** | Increases covert agent capacity | 7,500 |
| **Research** | Generates research points | 23,000 |
| **Supply** | Reduces military production costs | 11,500 |
| **Anti-Pollution** | Reduces pollution | 10,500 |

### Managing Planets

From the **Manage** screen:
1. View current planet counts
2. Buy new planets (prices increase as you own more)
3. Release (sell) planets if needed

**Tips:**
- Balance resource-producing planets with population needs
- Research planets are expensive but essential for tech upgrades
- Supply planets reduce military costs - valuable for large armies

## Appendix: Quick Reference

### Keyboard Shortcuts

The game primarily uses mouse navigation, but some pages support:
- **Enter** - Submit forms
- **Tab** - Navigate between fields

### Common Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Can't attack | Check protection status, treaty status |
| Starving population | Buy food from market or build food planets |
| Bankrupt | Sell military, release planets |
| Low effectiveness | Wait for natural recovery, win battles |
| No covert points | Wait for turn to regenerate points |

### Resource Formulas

**Food Production:**
```
Net Food = (Food Planets x 160) - (Population x 0.05) - (Soldiers x 0.16)
```

**Credit Income:**
```
Income = (Tourism Planets x 8,000) + (Population x Tax Rate) + (Urban x 1,000)
Expenses = (Planets x 168) + Military Maintenance
Net = (Income - Expenses) x Civil Status Multiplier
```

**Networth Calculation:**
```
Networth = (Planets x 10)
         + (Soldiers x 0.0005)
         + (Fighters x 0.001)
         + (Stations x 0.002)
         + (Light Cruisers x 0.001)
         + (Heavy Cruisers x 0.002)
         + (Carriers x 0.005)
         + (Covert Agents x 0.001)
```

### Game Events
