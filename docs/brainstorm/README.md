## How These Differ from Expansion Content

**Expansion content** (in `docs/expansion/`) represents the *planned* implementation approach.

**Brainstorm content** (here) represents *alternative* approaches that were considered but not chosen, or ideas that need more evaluation.

---

## Adding New Ideas

1. Create markdown file with clear STATUS header
2. Include "Why This Was Considered" section
3. Include "Why This Was Cut" section if applicable
4. Link design principles to core game design

---

## Reviewing Ideas

Before implementing any brainstorm idea:
1. Check alignment with [Game Design](../core/GAME-DESIGN.md)
2. Evaluate cognitive load impact
3. Consider new player experience
4. Get explicit approval
