## Pending Implementation

### Priority 1: Turn Phase Awareness

**Problem:** Players unsure what phase they're in

**Solution Ideas:**
- Phase indicator bar at top of screen
- "What should I do now?" contextual hints
- Phase transition animations

### Priority 2: Actionable Guidance

**Problem:** New players don't know what to do

**Solution Ideas:**
- "Recommended Actions" panel
- Context-sensitive tips based on game state
- Warning indicators for problems (food shortage, etc.)

### Priority 3: Navigation Clarity

**Problem:** Too many screens, unclear flow

**Solution Ideas:**
- Breadcrumb navigation
- "Back to Starmap" always visible
- Reduce click depth for common actions
