# Syndicate Expansion Concept: Hidden Traitor

**STATUS:** CONCEPT ONLY - Alternative syndicate mechanics
**Origin:** Redesign discussion January 2026
**Inspiration:** Betrayal at House on the Hill, Secret Hitler

---

## Concept

Instead of visible trust levels, the Syndicate becomes a **hidden traitor mechanic**.

### How It Works

1. At game start, 10-15% of bots are secretly Syndicate agents
2. Syndicate bots appear normal but have hidden goals
3. Player can choose to join Syndicate (becomes hidden traitor)
4. Traitors win if Syndicate controls 40% of galaxy

### Hidden Traitor Actions

| Action | Effect | Risk |
|--------|--------|------|
| **Signal** | Identify yourself to other traitors | May be noticed |
| **Sabotage** | Weaken non-traitor empire | Suspicion increases |
| **Frame** | Make innocent look guilty | May backfire |
| **Convert** | Try to recruit another empire | High risk/reward |

## Why This Was Considered

**Pros:**
- Creates paranoia and social deduction
- Exciting plot twists when traitors reveal
- Different from standard 4X gameplay
- Memorable stories ("I was betrayed by...")

**Cons:**
- Hard to balance in single-player (no humans to deceive)
- May feel unfair when AI betrays you
- Difficult to give player agency in traitor role
- Complexity of hidden information

---

## Why This Was Not Chosen

The standard Syndicate (visible trust progression) was selected because:
1. More transparent to player
2. Clear progression path
3. Player agency in choosing involvement
4. Easier to balance

---

## Potential Future Use

Could be adapted for:
- Special "conspiracy" scenario mode
- Multiplayer hidden traitor game mode
- End-game crisis events
