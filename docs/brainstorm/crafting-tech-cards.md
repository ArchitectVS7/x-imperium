# Crafting Expansion Concept: Tech Card Draft

**STATUS:** CONCEPT ONLY - Alternative to standard crafting
**Origin:** Redesign discussion January 2026
**Inspiration:** Lord of Waterdeep, Splendor

## Concept

Instead of supply chain management, crafting becomes a **tech card draft system**.

### How It Works

1. Each turn, 3-5 tech cards appear in a shared "market"
2. Players draft cards using resources
3. Cards provide permanent bonuses or one-time effects
4. Creates strategic competition for limited cards

### Example Cards

| Card | Cost | Effect |
|------|------|--------|
| **Reactor Blueprint** | 500 Ore, 200 Petroleum | Unlock Heavy Cruisers |
| **Shield Matrix** | 300 Research, 100 Credits | +10% defense |
| **Black Market Contact** | 1000 Credits | Access Syndicate shop |
| **Efficiency Drive** | 200 Research | -10% build costs |

## Why This Was Considered

**Pros:**
- Simpler than full supply chain
- Creates player interaction (racing for cards)
- Board game feel (familiar to target audience)
- Emergent strategy based on available cards

**Cons:**
- Less deterministic (depends on card draws)
- May feel random rather than strategic
- Harder to plan long-term builds

## Why This Was Not Chosen

The standard crafting system (supply chain) was selected because:
1. More predictable progression
2. Clearer economic depth
3. Players can plan multiple turns ahead
4. Better fits "empire building" fantasy

## Potential Future Use

Could be used for:
- Event cards (galactic events)
- Black Market items (random availability)
- Special bonus system alongside crafting
