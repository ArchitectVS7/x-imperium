# Research Concept: D20 Breakthrough System

**STATUS:** UNDER EVALUATION - Alternative research mechanics
**Origin:** Redesign discussion January 2026

---

## Concept

Instead of deterministic research point accumulation, research uses **D20 breakthrough rolls**.

### How It Works

1. Research Points accumulate as normal
2. At thresholds, roll D20 for breakthrough chance
3. Higher RP = better modifier to roll
4. Natural 20 = instant breakthrough + bonus
5. Natural 1 = research setback

### Breakthrough Table

| RP Accumulated | Base DC | Notes |
|----------------|---------|-------|
| 500 | 18 | Tier 1 unlock |
| 2,000 | 15 | Tier 2 unlock |
| 5,000 | 12 | Tier 3 unlock |
| 10,000+ | 10 | Capstone unlock |

**Roll:** D20 + (RP / 500) vs DC

### Example Outcomes

| Roll | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Natural 20** | Instant unlock + choose bonus specialization |
| **Beat DC by 5+** | Unlock + minor bonus |
| **Beat DC** | Normal unlock |
| **Fail by 1-4** | Almost there (try again next turn) |
| **Fail by 5+** | Setback (-10% RP) |
| **Natural 1** | Disaster (lose 20% RP, scandal event) |

## Why This Was Considered

**Pros:**
- Adds excitement to research milestones
- Creates dramatic moments
- Consistent with D20 combat system
- Natural 20 moments are memorable

**Cons:**
- May feel too random for strategic planning
- Could frustrate players who want predictability
- Hard to plan builds around uncertain unlocks
- May conflict with "4X strategy" expectations

## Current Status

The draft-based 3-tier research system was implemented for v1.0. This D20 variant remains under evaluation for:
- Optional "chaos mode" difficulty
- Breakthrough events (rare special research)
- Experimental game modes

---

## Alternative: Hybrid Approach

Could combine both systems:
- Deterministic tier unlocks (draft system)
- D20 rolls for bonus discoveries
- Best of both worlds

*Under evaluation. May be implemented as optional mode.*
