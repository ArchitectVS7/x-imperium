# X-Imperium: Milestone Build Plan

**Version:** 1.2
**Date:** December 24, 2024
**Status:** Approved

## Philosophy: Vertical Slices with Testable Outcomes

Each milestone delivers a **playable vertical slice** that can be tested end-to-end. This approach:
- Validates assumptions early
- Catches integration issues immediately
- Provides tangible progress checkpoints
- Enables stakeholder demos at each stage

✅ Planet list shows 9 planets with correct types — STARTING_PLANETS constant: 2 Food, 2 Ore, 1 Petroleum, 1 Tourism, 1 Urban, 1 Government, 1 Research
✅ Resource calculations match PRD values:
  - 2 Food planets × 160 = 320 food/turn — constants.ts PLANET_PRODUCTION.food = 160
  - 2 Ore planets × 112 = 224 ore/turn — constants.ts PLANET_PRODUCTION.ore = 112

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (Audited 2024-12-24)

### Deliverables
- ✅ Turn processing pipeline (6 phases from PRD) — *`src/lib/game/services/turn-processor.ts` (~500 lines)*
- ✅ Resource production per turn — *`processTurnResources()` in resource-engine.ts*
- ✅ Resource consumption (maintenance) — *168 credits/planet via `calculateMaintenanceCost()`*
- ✅ **Civil Status system** (PRD 4.4):
  - ✅ 8 levels: Ecstatic → Revolting — *`CIVIL_STATUS_LEVELS` in constants.ts*
  - ✅ Income multiplier (0.25× to 4×) — *`CIVIL_STATUS_INCOME_MULTIPLIERS` in constants.ts*
  - ✅ Status changes based on events — *`evaluateCivilStatus()` in civil-status.ts*
- ✅ **Population mechanics**:
  - ✅ Growth per turn (if fed) — *2% growth rate in population.ts*
  - ✅ Consumption: 0.05 food per citizen — *`FOOD_CONSUMPTION_PER_CITIZEN` constant*
- ✅ "End Turn" button — *`EndTurnButton` component with debounce + accessibility*
- ✅ Turn counter display — *`TurnCounter` component with milestone highlighting*
- ✅ Performance logging (JSONL) — *`perfLogger.log()` captures turn processing time*

### Test Criteria
```
✅ Clicking "End Turn" increments turn counter — endTurnAction() updates game.currentTurn
✅ Resources change according to planet production — processTurnResources() applies multipliers
✅ Planet maintenance (168 credits/planet) deducted — PLANET_MAINTENANCE_COST = 168
✅ Turn processing completes in <500ms (no bots) — Performance target met
✅ Performance log captures timing data — perfLogger.log() with durationMs
✅ Civil Status affects income:
  - Ecstatic: 4× multiplier — CIVIL_STATUS_INCOME_MULTIPLIERS.ecstatic = 4.0
  - Content: 2× multiplier — CIVIL_STATUS_INCOME_MULTIPLIERS.content = 2.0
  - Unhappy: 1× multiplier (baseline) — CIVIL_STATUS_INCOME_MULTIPLIERS.unhappy = 1.0
✅ Population grows when food surplus exists — calculatePopulationGrowth() at 2%/turn
✅ Population consumes food (0.05/citizen/turn) — calculateFoodConsumption()
✅ Food deficit triggers civil status drop — shouldDowngradeStatus() checks food_deficit
✅ Starvation causes population loss — calculateStarvation() with graduated rates
```

### Turn Processing Order
1. Income collection (with civil status multiplier)
2. Population update (growth/starvation)
3. Civil status evaluation
4. Market processing (stub for M3)
5. Bot decisions (stub for M5)
6. Actions (stub for M4+)
7. Maintenance (integrated in Phase 1)
8. Victory check (stub for M6)

### Database Tables

## MILESTONE 12: LLM Bots (Tier 1)

**Duration**: 4 days
**Dependency**: M11
**Testable**: Yes
**Gate**: v0.7 Alpha

### Deliverables
- Upgrade 10 bots to Tier 1 (LLM-powered)
- OpenAI-compatible provider abstraction
- Provider failover chain (Groq → Together → OpenAI)
- Async LLM processing (compute next turn's decisions)
- Natural language message generation
- Context-aware strategic decisions
- Rate limiting:
  - 5,000 calls per game
  - 50 calls per turn
  - 500 calls per hour
  - $50/day spending cap
- Cost tracking and alerts
- Graceful fallback to Tier 2

### Test Criteria
```
✓ LLM bots generate natural language messages
✓ Messages are contextually appropriate
✓ Messages reflect bot's archetype and emotional state
✓ Provider failover works when primary unavailable
✓ Async processing doesn't block turn completion
✓ Turn processing still <2 seconds with LLM bots
✓ Rate limits enforced correctly
✓ Cost tracking logs all API calls
✓ Alert triggers at 80% of daily budget
✓ Fallback to Tier 2 on LLM failure
```

### Technical Notes
- Use Vercel AI SDK for provider abstraction
- LLM decisions computed for NEXT turn while current turn resolves
- Fallback to Tier 2 logic if LLM timeout/failure
